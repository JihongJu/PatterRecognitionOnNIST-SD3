NIST's Special Database 3 contain binary images of handwritten digits learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data.
Matlab Pattern Recognition Toolbox PRTools (http://prtools.org/) was utilized to implement various classification alogrithms.

##Two tasks
1. The pattern recognition system is trained once, and then applied in the field; **(training data: at least 200 and at most 1000 objects per class)**
2. The pattern recognition system is trained for each.**(training data: at most 10 objects per class)**

##Choice of representation
1. Pixels
2. Features
3. Dissimilarities
